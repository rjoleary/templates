# Templates

In Ubuntu, right clicking in a folder will reveal the `New Document` menu. This
is a shortcut for creating commonly used file types known as templates. They
come from the folder `$HOME/Templates`. This repository contains some templates
you might find useful.

The templates included are:

+ `HTML5.html`       - probably not the best boilerplate, but is still
                       functional
+ `LaTeX.txt`        - a simple latex article with a title and a section
+ `OpenDocument.odt` - a blank document for use in OpenOffice or LibreOffice
+ `PNG.png`          - a blank PNG image of size 256x256 pixels
+ `Python.py`        - a python script containing a shebang and main function
+ `Text.txt`         - an empty text file containing a single `\n`


## Installation

The `install.sh` script copies all the new template files to the `Templates`
folder.  If you can't run the script, it's easy enough to copy the files
manually.


## License

The license is found in the `LICENSE.txt` file.
